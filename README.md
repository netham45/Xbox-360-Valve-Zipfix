# Xbox-360-Valve-Zipfix
This is a tool that allows easy creation and modification of Xbox 360 zip0.360.zip files for VALVe games. This tool is no longer under development and is being uploaded for archival.


Usage
Extraction
Get size in bytes of file (This is provided already for TF2's zip0.360.zip)
Enter your zip name in the Zip -> Folder option
Enter the folder to extract to in the Zip -> Folder option
Extract. This will take some time.
Editing
Rename __preload_section.pre to _!preload_section.pre
Edit whatever you want
Notes
Keep any new files added in a seperate location, they will be added later. Only keep changes to existing files in the folder
Do not add any large resource files, there is a cap of ~14MB
Recompiling the ZIP
Enter the path to the new zip you wish to create under 'Zip' in Folder->Zip
Enter the path to the folder that contains the extracted and modified zip in 'Folder'
Hit Folder -> Zip. This will take a while.
Open the zip in WinRAR (I've only used WinRAR)
Place any extra files you might have into the zip now. When you add them, make sure that you set the compression level to 'Store' [image].
Enter the path to the new zip under 'Zip' in 'Pad Zip'. Place the desired size in the 'size' box (Note: the correct size for Team Fortress 2's zip0.360.zip is provided for you)
Hit 'Pad Zip'. This may take a while.
